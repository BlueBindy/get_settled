                <h3>Applications are made by paper form</h3>
                <p>Adult British citizens should Form 8 (version 6.7 July 2022)
                    which is found <a

                    in Ireland, based on the scorecard approach introduced in January 2022. You'll need documents worth
                    150 points
                    for your required residency; the scorecard can be found <a

                <h3>The total process takes between 5 and 7 years</h3>
                <p>If you are married to an Irish citizen and living in Ireland, you'll need
                    to prove 3 years residency. All other British citizens will need to prove they have
                    lived in Ireland for 5 years. The current time to process a straightforward application submitted
                    from 2022 onwards averages 19 months. So, between residency and application it is roughly
                    a 5 to 7 year process. Please note, if you have Irish parents
                    or grandparents you should use the <a

                    process as you need to prove ancestry not residency.
