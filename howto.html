                <h3>Residents need 5 years residency and spouses of Irish citizens need 3 years</h3>
                <p>If you are married to an Irish citizen and living in Ireland, you'll need
                    to prove 3 years residency. All other British citizens will need to prove they have
                    lived in Ireland for 5 years. The current time to process a straightforward application submitted
                    from 2022 onwards averages 19 months. So, between residency and application it is roughly
                    a 5 to 7 year process. Please note, if you have Irish parents
                    or grandparents you should use the <a
