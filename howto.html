                <p>The application form for adult British citizens is Form 8 (version 6.7 July 2022) 
                    and can be found <a href="https://www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/become-an-irish-citizen-by-naturalisation/#forms"
                target="_blank">here.</a> You will need to attach documents to evidence your residency
            in Ireland, based on the scorecard approach introduced in January 2022. You'll need documents worth 150 points
        for your required residency; the scorecard can be found <a href="https://www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/become-an-irish-citizen-by-naturalisation/proofs-of-residence/"
    target="_blank">here.</a> Finally, you'll also need the application fee, a certified copy of your passport/s covering your residency
your birth certificate and two witnessed photographs.</p>

                <p>If you are married to an Irish citizen and living in Ireland, you'll need
                    to prove 3 years residency. All other British citizens will need to prove they have
                    lived in Ireland for 5 years. The current time to process the application is 23 months.
                    So, for all British people it is a 5 to 7 year process. Please note, if you have Irish parents
                    or grandparents you should use the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/citizenship/born-abroad/registering-a-foreign-birth/" target="_blank">Foreign Birth Registration</a> process
                    as you do not need to prove residency.
