            <h3>Applicants face a limit on time spent out of Ireland</h3>
            <p>To qualify for citizenship by residency, you must prove that you
                have 'reckonable residence' in Ireland for at least 5 years (1825 or 1826 days if any leap years)
                out of the last 9 years. This includes 1 year (365 or 366 days if a leap year) of
                'continuous residence' immediately before the date you apply. 'Continuous residence'
                doesn't mean you can't leave Ireland at all in your final year. It means you must have been physically
                in Ireland for at least 323 days of the last 365. In other words, you can not be away for more than 6
                weeks
                (42 days) in your final year. This <a

            <p>The Minister for Justice has <a href="https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2022-03-01/590/"
                    target="_blank">confirmed

                from Ireland for longer than
                6 weeks after application you need to notify the Department
                of Justice (email citizenshipinfo@justice.ie quoting your Application ID number)
                explaining the purpose of your trip. It is unclear why notification of absence is required, but it
                may relate to the time limits placed on candidate responses to Department correspondence.
