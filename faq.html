                <p>To qualify for citizenship by residency, you must prove that you
                    have been resident in Ireland for at least 5 years (1825 or 1826 days if any leap years)
                    out of the last 9 years. This includes 1 year (365 or 366 days if a leap year) of
                    'continuous residence' immediately before the date you apply. 'Continuous residence'
                    doesn't mean you can't leave Ireland at all in your final year. To have your last year
                    recognised as reckonable residence, 'continuous residence' you must have been physically in Ireland
                    for
                    at least 323 days; that is, not away for more than 6 weeks (42 days.) This <a

                <h3>The 6 week rule applies post application</h3>
                <p>The Department of Justice are clear that if you are away
                    from Ireland for longer than 6 weeks after you have applied you need to notify them
                    ( use citizenshipinfo@justice.ie quoting your Application ID number if you have one)
                    and explain why. However, the Minister for Justice has <a
